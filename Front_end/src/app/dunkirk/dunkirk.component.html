  In May 1940, Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. <br>Under air and ground cover
  from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable naval
  and civilian vessel that could be found. <br>At the end of this heroic mission, 330,000 French, British, Belgian and Dutch
  soldiers were safely evacuated.
